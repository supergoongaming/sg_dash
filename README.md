## Development
- Mostly developed on macos apple silicon
- Going to build on Mac, Linux, Windows, Emscripten throughout development

## Goals
- Better at C
- Learn github actions better
- Learn embedding dotnet/runtime
- Create a simple "Geometry Dash" clone.
- Better at cross-platform building (Macos, Linux, Windows)
#### Stretch Goals
- Game build on Mobile (IOS priority)

## Building
<!-- - If you have the libraries installed, just use the make rebuild command
- Otherwise, use the full builds in the makefile for your platform -->

## Current State
<!-- - Loads a tilemap and draws it to the screen.
- Currently no gameobjects.
- Builds on all platforms in runners. -->

## Requirements
<!-- - Cmake will install all of the required libraries with all of the rebuild commands in make except "rebuild". -->

## Components
- CMake: The actual cross-platform build system.
<!-- - SDL2: Low Level handling of windowing, events, input -->
- Make: Streamlining building with one command
<!-- - Emscripten: Build for web -->
- dotnet/runtime: Embedded Scripting
